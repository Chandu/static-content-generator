# static-content-generator
Infrastructure to create static html site with the aid of
- [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/) (templating engine)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (style sheet pre-processor)
- [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) (buid-tool)

This is extended/rewritten version of the idea described in the article ["Create a static site generator with less than 100 lines of code"](http://www.travishanna.com/static-site-generator.html) by Travis Hanna.
